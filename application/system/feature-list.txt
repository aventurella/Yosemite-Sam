Task Estimates
	- When tasks are present, add the ability to create estimates against
	that task, eg: This region will take 4 hours to complete.
	
Note Commenting
	- once note/annotation is saved show who created the note and allow others to comment on it
	
View Thumbnail preview
	- In view page, show thumbnail preview of comp with dots notating where notes/annotations are
	- list notes/annotations and be able to assign them to a user (tie in with tasks estimates feature)
	
Add Priority to Tasks
	- give a task a priority (weight) to show importance compared to other tasks
	
Status of task
	- assignee can acknowledge status of a task (open, closed, in progress)
	- assignee can include estimation of time needed to complete task
	- table view of estimation and shows tasks with no esimated time, as well as total time estimated for view/project

Project Export/Import
	- Uses can export(archive) and import projects.
	- Deleting all information is not a threat as you can just save the data
	- Deleting a project or a view cascades to it's children, if any.  
	  In other words deleting a task would only delete that task
	  Deleting a View, would delete all the states and tasks, etc
	
PDF Report generation
	- each page is a view/state with its notes and tasks
	- all annotations are mapped on the comp of the view and there is a legend explaining each annotation (task/note)
